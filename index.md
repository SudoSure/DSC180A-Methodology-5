## Prompts and Answers

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topics covered in my domain this quarter so far were reward modeling, multimodal reasoning, web agents, natural langauge simulation agents, etc. I found it particularly engaging because it is the cutting edge of
research on large language models.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For my Quarter 2 Project, I would like to investigate how we can use multimodal reasoning on web agents and natural language simulation with reward model improvement. This investigation could involve many aspects of large language models
like different reasoning and rewarding approaches.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
One potential change I’d make to the approach in my Quarter 1 Project is try more things out and see if it works or not. This could help address the outcome of continually researching and finding out it is already done or it does not work.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would be interested in exploring techniques like different applications of the methods on top of further optimizing them.
